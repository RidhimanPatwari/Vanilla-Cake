Hello!

This folder will have 3 Markdown files including this one. This file is an introduction. The next one, ingredients.md is... well, ingredients; it's self-explanatory. The one after that, recipe.md is the actual recipe (again, self-explanatory). In the following files is the ingredients and recipe to make Vanilla Cake! You can follow along or just read and save it for later when you really just use it after a year and a half (as I always do ðŸ˜œðŸ¤£).

In case you don't know too much about the files side of thing, a Markdown file is just a file with text in it. It is sometimes used to keep notes although in Windows there is a Notepad app and in Mac there is a Notes app.
