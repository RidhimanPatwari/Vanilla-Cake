Using the ingredients in the previous file, you can make a vanilla cake by doing the following steps:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.

Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. 

Beat 2 sticks, butter, and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy for about 3 minutes. 

Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. 

Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) 

Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.

Divide the batter between the prepared pans. 

Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. 

Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level.

If you want cream as well, follow the steps below:

Once cool, spread frosting on the top and sides, the cut down the center horizontally and spread the frosting in the middle.

You have made a vanilla cake!
